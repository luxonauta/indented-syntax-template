# :monkey: PugJs Template Boilerplate!

This is a generic template, for those who need or want to work using [PugJs](https://pugjs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/).

To automate this work environment, [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is used.

## :rocket: Getting Started

To start using, all you need to do is install the development dependencies, using the code below in your terminal:

> Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your operating system first!

```
    npm i
```

Now, just run the command below on your terminal:

```
    npm run gulp
```

### :bricks: The template structure

In ``structure`` you will assemble your layout, which will be imported by your pages, here is called your reset style, built in the ``sass`` folder.

The pages can also include others from the ``includes`` folder, in addition to including the page style and scripts, built into the ``coffee`` folder.
