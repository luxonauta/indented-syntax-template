# :flying_saucer: PugJs Template Boilerplate!

This project is a generic template, to work using [PugJs](https://pugjs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/).

For it to be efficient, the work environment has to be automated, and for that, [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is necessary.

## :rocket: Getting Started

To start using, all you need to do is install the development dependencies, using the code below in your terminal:

> Make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your operating system first!

```
npm i
```

Now, just run the command below on your terminal:

```
npm run gulp
```

### :bricks: The template structure

In the ``structure`` folder, you will assemble your layout, which your pages will import, they are responsible for calling the style, coded in the ``sass`` folder.

The pages can also include others, from the ``includes`` folder and scripts, from the ``coffee`` folder.
